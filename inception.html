        Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a thief with the rare ability to enter
        people's dreams and steal their secrets from their subconscious.<br />His
        skill has made him a hot commodity in the world of corporate espionage
        but has also cost him everything he loves.<br />Cobb gets a chance at
        redemption when he is offered a seemingly impossible task: Plant an idea
        in someone's mind.<br />If he succeeds, it will be the perfect crime,
        but a dangerous enemy anticipates Cobb's every move.
