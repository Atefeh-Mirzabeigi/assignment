      <h4>Directed by: Tom Tykwer</h4>
      <p>
        With his incredible talent for discerning scents, Jean-Baptiste
        Grenouille (Ben Whishaw) is one of 18th-century France's finest
        perfumers. <br />
        He becomes obsessed with capturing an elusive aroma: the scent of young
        womanhood. <br />
        His search takes a deadly turn, and when the bodies of 12 young females
        are found, panic breaks out, with families rushing to lock up their
        daughters.
