        A man (Hugh Jackman) travels through time on a quest for immortality and
        to save the woman (Rachel Weisz) he loves. As a 16th-century
        conquistador, Tomas searches for the legendary Fountain of Youth. As a
        present-day scientist, he desperately struggles to cure the cancer that
        is killing his wife. Finally, as a 26th-century astronaut in deep space,
        Tom begins to grasp the mysteries of life, love and death.
