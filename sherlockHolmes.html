      <p>
        Sherlock Holmes lives in 21st-century London, a city filled with
        mystery, crime, and deceit. <br />
        The back streets are alive with robbers, blackmailers, smugglers, and
        serial killers. <br />
        When the police are desperate they call upon Mr Sherlock Holmes and his
        unconventional methods of deduction to shed light on the matter.
